= Querying

This tutorial shows how to create a simple Cypher query to match and return Movies using the Cypher Builder:

```cypher
MATCH(m:Movie)
RETURN m
```

== Matching nodes

First, you need to define a node variable. You can do it by creating a new instance of `Cypher.Node`:

```javascript
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});
```

Create a `MATCH` clause and pass the node variable as an argument:

```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode);
```

== Returning the variable

To `RETURN` the Node variables, use the `.return` method in the `match` clause:

```javascript
clause.return(movieNode);
```

Alternatively, you can do the same thing by creating the clause in a single statement:

```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);
```


== Building the Cypher query

After the query is ready, it is time to build it. 
This step will generate the actual Cypher string that can be used in a Neo4j database:

```javascript
const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

== Conclusion

+
Altogether, your script should look something like this:

```javascript
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";

const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});

const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);

const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

Now, if you execute `node main.js` again, it will output the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0
```

[NOTE]
====
You may be wondering where `this0` come from, this is an autogenerated name for the Node variable created by the Cypher Builder.
