= Your first query

In this guide, you'll create a simple Cypher query to match and return Movies using the Cypher Builder:

```cypher
MATCH(m:Movie)
RETURN m
```

== Matching nodes
First, you need to define a node variable. You can do it by creating a new instance of `Cypher.Node`:

```javascript
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});
```

Then, you need to create a `MATCH` clause and pass the node variable as an argument:

```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode);
```

== Returning the variable

The second part of the query is the `RETURN` of the Node variables, you can do this with the `.return` method in the match clause:

```javascript
clause.return(movieNode);
```

More succinctly, this can be done when creating the clause in a single statement:

```javascript
const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);
```


== Building the Cypher query

The last step, once we have our query ready, is to **build** it. This will generate the actual Cypher string that can be used in a Neo4j database:

```javascript
const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

== Conclusion

+
Altogether, your script should look something like this:

```javascript
import Cypher from "@neo4j/cypher-builder";

const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({
  labels: ["Movie"]
});

const clause = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).return(movieNode);

const { cypher } = clause.build();

console.log(cypher);
```

Now, if you execute `node main.js` again, it will output the following query:

```cypher
MATCH (this0:Movie)
RETURN this0
```

[NOTE]
====
You may be wondering where `this0` come from, this is an autogenerated name for the Node variable created by the Cypher Builder.

In the next tutorial, you'll spice up this query with some filtering and projection.
