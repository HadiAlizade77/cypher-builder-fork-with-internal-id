:description: This page describes how to create EXISTS subqueries with the Cypher Builder.
= `Exists`

Cypher link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/subqueries/existential/[`EXISTS` subqueries] can be created with `new Cypher.Exists()`. 
To do this, a valid query needs to be passed to `Exists`. 

Note that count subqueries can also be used as predicates in `WHERE` clauses, for example:

[source, javascript]
----
const subquery = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] })).return("*");

const existsExpression = new Cypher.Exists(subquery);
const match = new Cypher.Match(new Cypher.Node()).where(existsExpression).return("*");
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0)
WHERE EXISTS {
    MATCH (this1:Movie)
    RETURN *
}
RETURN *
----
