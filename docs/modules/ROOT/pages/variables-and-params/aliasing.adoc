= Aliasing

Variables are commonly used for aliasing in a `WITH` or `RETURN` statement. 
To do that, you need to pass a tuple of the value and its alias.

== Aliasing to a string
This is how you should proceed when aliasing to a string:
[source, javascript]
----
const node = new Cypher.Node({
    labels: ["Movie"],
});
const withQuery = new Cypher.With([node, "my-alias"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
WITH this0 AS my-alias
----

== Aliasing to a variable

Instead of an exact string, you can alias to a `Cypher.Variable` so it can be reused as any other variable:

[source, javascript]
----
const movieNode = new Cypher.Node({ labels: ["Movie"] });
const myVar = new Cypher.Variable();
const match = new Cypher.Match(movieNode).with([movieNode, myVar]).return([myVar, "Film"]);
----

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (this0:`Movie`)
WITH this0 AS var1
RETURN var1 AS Film 
----

In the previous example, after a `MATCH` the node variable `this0` is aliased to a variable with an arbitrary name (`var1`) in a `WITH` statement. 
Finally, in the `RETURN` the variable is aliased to the specific name `Film` that will be returned.
